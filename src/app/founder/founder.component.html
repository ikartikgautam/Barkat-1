                        Passionate about delivering service that brings the difference in the life of those who matter.
                        Randeep
                        Singh Kohli is a social activist, a successful entrepreneur, Co-founder of Barkat Welfare
                        Society,
                        Amritsar Bulletin and Director -World Book of Records, Australia
                        <br><br>
                        “Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.”
                        This
                        beautiful quote of humanitarian Randeep Singh Kohli describes his whole existence and his work
                        so far.
                        He is a charismatic gentleman who is no stranger to social service and humanitarian causes.
                        Being the
                        grandchild of former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, Randeep has seen, first hand, what
                        statesmanship is. In fact, he has learnt it from the best, considering the fact that Dr. Singh
                        is
                        revered across the political and economic spectrum of the country. Randeep is a skilled orator
                        who has
                        shared his pearls of wisdom on platforms like TedEx, Josh Talks and MS Talks. He is a really
                        inspiring
                        figure for the youth of today, who are often found stuck between what to do and what not to do
                        in their
                        daily lives. He is also active in the field of social justice. This is proved by the 100 RTI
                        queries
                        that he has filed to invite attention to public issues.
                        <br><br>
                        Most importantly, Randeep finds solace in a quote by the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi,
                        in which
                        the latter says, “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.”
