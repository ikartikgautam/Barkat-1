                        Randeep Singh Kohli along with his sister Pushmeet Kaur Kohli in the year 2014. Barkat stands

                        society.</p>
                <p > We aim to provide education,
                        healthcare, and community development to the underprivileged population across India. We've
                        worked for a lot of social cause be it distributing clothes to the underprivileged, installing
                        reflection radiators on the road for Road safety, raising funds for the people in need. The
                        noble deeds of Barkat have been recognized and appreciated by the International Conference and
                        Human library.</p>
